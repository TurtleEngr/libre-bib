* Example Outline - Create Docs
- This is an example of using emacs org-mode to create documents.
- It is a good starting point for large documents. It can be easily
  converted to html for reviews.
- Once things look good, the html file can be converted to a
  libreoffice odt (write) file. After that conversion, you'll continue
  work only with the odt file, to format the final document.
** Tips
*** org-mode tips
- For help with emacs org-mode see: https://orgmode.org/manuals.html
+ Use a '-' at the  beginning of blocks of text, so the blocks can be
  collapsed with TAB. The html conversion will remove the '-' and
  treat it as a paragraph (not a list item).
+ If you want a text block to be a bullet list item, prefix it with a
  '+'
+ Use '* ', '** ', or '*** ', at the beginning of section. TAB will
  expand/collapse the sections. You can used more '*', but only the
  first 3 levels will be converted to HTML h1, h2, etc tags.
+ '<' and '>' characers will be preserved in the HTML output,
  so can use HTML for some formatting.
+ Do try the table creation mode in org-mode. It is quick and easy
  for simple tables.
*** HTML tips
+ Use css to control the formatting.
+ Convert the file to HTML with pandoc. A sed script is used to fix up
  things before converting. Use: bib to do the conversion.  For
  example:

  <pre>
  bib example-outline.html
  </pre>
*** biblography tips
+ biblio.txt
+ biblio-note.txt
+ Libre-Bib app
+ LibraryThing
*** Libreoffice Write
+ Only use "styles" to make formatting changes to text in a docuument.
  Select the desired text, then select the style.
+ Use the style tool to modify the style of your page, paragraphs, and
  characters.
+ Need some special formatting, make up a your own style, under a
  similar style. Never make a manual change to the text.
** The full process
*** Org Doc File
+ edit things with: emacs FILE.org (adding {REF} tags as desired)
+ Create HTML file: bib FILE.html
+ Create write file: bib FILE.odt
+ Now only edit FILE.odt
*** biblio.txt File
+ Edit biblio.txt with references "Id:" is the most important tag.
+ Import biblio.txt: bib import-lo
+ Import librarything.tsv: bib import-lib 
+ Update lo table with lib table: bib update-lo
+ Export a new biblio.txt file with lib changes: bib export-lo
*** Libreoffice Write
+ Run libreoffice and attach to the bib DB (see libre-bib manual)
+ Use the EndNote character style to format the {REF} tags
  (But do not manually apply that style!)
+ Use bib to update all new {REF}s from the DB: bib bib-new
+ If the DB has changed, update the {REF}s: bib bib-update
+ Create the Bibliography at the end of doc
+ Edit the Biblio style for each of REF types used.

** Examples
*** Bullet lists
- See the earler part of this doc for examples. Look for '+' at
  beginning of the lines
*** Tables
- This is a simple table. Start with a '|', Head1 , '|', Head2, '|',
  TAB Go to the new line with '|'s, backkup and make a '|-' at the
  beginning, then TAB. Now the heading part is defined. Continue with
  puting text between the bars, hitting TAB when you are done with
  a row.

  | Head1                            | Head1                           |
  |----------------------------------+---------------------------------|
  | row1 item                        | row2 item                       |
  | what if it is a really long line | It will scale to fit            |
  |                                  | And the css can do the wrapping |
*** Block quotes
- Simply use the blockquote tag. And add the {REF} after the quote.

  - <blockquote>ssara df sda fdsa sf dsa
    fads{eisenstein-12}</blockquote>
*** Cites inline

- Citations can also be used inline.{eisenstein-10}
