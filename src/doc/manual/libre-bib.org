** Install Package

+ If you install with a libre-bib.deb package with a package manager
  such as "apt", all of the required and most of the optional packages
  will be installed.

+ If you are installing from tgz file, then you'll need to install
  these manually.

*** Required Packages

+ bash (5.1 version probably not too important)
+ libreoffice (7.0)
+ libreoffice-sdbc-mysql (7.0) - needed for libreoffice DB connection
+ make - for script and file management
+ mariadb-client (10.5) - mysql
+ mariadb-server (10.5) - mariadbd (only needed on remote host)
+ pandoc - required to convert org to odt
+ perl (5.32) for: pod2html, pod2man, pod2text, pod2usage
+ php (7.4 or greater)
+ php-mysqlnd - php-PDO
+ sed (4.7 version probably not important)
+ tidy (5.6 version probably not important)

*** Optional Packages

+ beekeeper - https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio
+ pod2pdf

*** Required Packages for Building

+ libpod-markdown-perl - pod2markdown
+ phptidy.php
+ shfmt
+ shunit2 or shunit2.1

*** Config

+ run libreoffice at least once before doing more with libre-bib
+ edit the cli/php.ini file (for example: /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini)
  Change the ="variables_order"= to this:
  <blockquote>
  =variables_order = "EGPCS"=
  </blockquote>

** Setup libre-bib project

Run:
  <blockquote>
  bib setup-bib
  </blockquote>

Fix any errors then run it again, until no more errors.

If you are planing on using a remote DB, then see the "Configure ssh" section.

** Configure the DB
*** Install and test

- The DB packages, mariadb-client and mariadb-server, have been
  installed on the remote server (or local sever if you are doing this
  all on one server).  Most likely the mariadbd process will already
  be running. Verify this with:

  <blockquote>
  ps -fC mariadbd
  </blockquote>

- If you don't see it running, you'll need to consult the mariadb docs
  to get it running.

+ https://opensource.com/article/20/10/mariadb-mysql-linux  (alt: https://archive.ph/yhDHm )
+ https://mariadb.com/docs/server/ref/cs10.3/

The first one is a good source for quickly getting going. Depending on
your distribution, you may need to do things a bit differently.

Test the connection on the server system

  <blockquote>
  sudo mysql -P 3306 -u root -p
  </blockquote>

Most likely you'll use your sudo password, or the password you setup
for the mysql DB root user.

*** Create DB, Users, and Grants

While signed in as root user to the DB type these commands.
Replace the $cgNAME variables with the values of those variables
in your project/conf.env file. You can change those now or just use
the example names to try things out.

+ Connect to the DB

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
sudo -s
mysql -P 3306 -u root -p
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

+ Create the DB

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
create database $cgDbName;
show databases;
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

+ Create users

  The create user and grants are best done with the 'root' DB user
  on the mysql system.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
create user 'admin'@'localhost' identified by 'ADMIN-PASS';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'admin'@localhost;

create user '$cgDbUser'@'localhost' identified by 'USER-PASS';
grant all privileges on $cgDbName.* to '$cgDbUser'@localhost;

flush privileges;

select user from mysql.user;
show grants for 'root'@localhost;
show grants for 'admin'@localhost;
show grants for '$cgDbUser'@localhost;

quit;
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

+ Test a local connection with $cgDbName

  <blockquote>
  mysql -P 3306 -u $cgDbName -p -h 127.0.0.1 $cgDbName
  </blockquote>

+ If you will be using libre-bib on the same system as the DB, then
  try connecting with the "bib" command.

  <blockquote>
  bib connect
  </blockquote>

If that doesn't work look at the cgDsn variable setting in
project/conf.env. It should be set to $cgLocalDsn for local
access. Try again, If that works, your conf.env setting are good for
continuing (skip the ssh section and other areas mentioning remote db
access).

** Configure ssh

In your ~/.ssh/ dir you should see a libre-bib.ssh file. For this to be
setup properly edit your project/conf.env file. Set the variables:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
| conf.env var   | Description                              |
|----------------+------------------------------------------|
| cgDbHost       | keep this set to the localhost IP        |
| cgDbName       | name of the mysql database               |
| cgDbPortRemote | remote port, on project's system.        |
| cgDbLocalPort  | port for mysql on the remote system      |
| cgDbUser       | DB user with grants to cgDbName          |
| cgDbPassHint   | hint for the password prompt             |
| cgDbSshUser    | user that can login to the remote system |
| cgDbSshKey     | key login to the remote system           |
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

Remove ~/ssh/libre-bib.ssh file and run again:

  <blockquote>
  bib setup-bib
  </blockquote>

If the ~/ssh/libre-bib.ssh file looks OK, add following line top of
your ~/.ssh/config file (or near a Host config for your system).

  <blockquote>
  Include libre-bib.ssh
  </blockquote>

If you want to add more ssh options for the Host, don't add them to
libre-bib.ssh, because that could be overwritten if project/conf.env
is changed. Create another Host line with the same host name and add
the option you want.

*** Test the tunnel

Do this after you have setup the DB, and you have tested connecting
locally.

In a terminal ssh to the remote system.

  <blockquote>
  ssh $cgDbSshUser@$cgDbHostRemote
  </blockquote>

Leave the terminal window open and start another terminal window.  In
the new terminal window type:

  <blockquote>
  telnet 127.0.0.1 $cgDbPortRemote
  </blockquote>

You should see "Connected to 127.0.0.1" and probably password
prompt. Exit with ctrl-C or ctrl-] then "quit".

Now test the connection to the database:

  <blockquote>
  mysql -P $cgDbPortRemote -u $cgDbUser -p -h 127.0.0.1 $cgDbName
  </blockquote>

If that doesn't work, look at the error message and see what needs to
be fixed. Check: db user name, db name, ports, grants and other
settings on the db system.

If that does work, try connecting with the "bib" command.

  <blockquote>
  bib connect
  </blockquote>

If that doesn't work look at the cgDsn variable setting in
project/conf.env. It should be set to $cgRemoteDsn for remote
access. Try again, If that works, your conf.env setting are good for
continuing.

* Using libre-bib
** Quick Start
- This shows a minimal setup with a local DB. This will use the
  example files and the minimal default configuration.
- For a detailed example see Appendix "A Full Example."

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
mkdir -p project/biblio
cd project/biblio
bib setup-bib      # This creates your default conf.env file
edit conf.env      # Uncomment and set these values

    cgDbUser="YOUR-DB-USER"
    cgDbPassHint="YOUR-HINT"
bib setup-bib      # Your project are will be setup
bib                # List the bib commands
bib connect        # Connect to DB to cache the  password
bib import-lo      # Import the biblio.txt file
bib ref-new        # Use DB values for any new REFs
bib ref-update     # Update REFs with any DB changes
libreoffice example.odt
    # Load styles from another odt file (optional)
    # Add bibliography to end of document
    # Set the bibliography Type > Brackets to "none"
bib style-update   # Define the bibliography > Entries for the different Types
bib style-save     # Run this if you change bibliography > Entries
</pre>

*** Files and Dirs

This will be a quick summary of the directories and files setup in your
project directory. The details will be describe in later sections as
they are used.

The bib commands will notice changes and rebuild any dependent files
they need. So you might see more things running than what you've seen
before. The "Env-Var" column show the variable for the File-Dir.  The
Cmd column shows the command or commands that create or use the
File-Dir.

+ File: **/opt/libre-bib/doc/example/conf.env** - Example document config

  This file is copied to $PWD/conf.env when you first run bib.

+ File: **/opt/libre-bib/etc/conf.env** - System config

  All the default values must be defined in this file. You can edit
  this file to override things for all your bib directories, but it
  would be better to edit ~/.config/libre-bib/conf.env.  That way the
  app can be updated without overriding your changes.

+ File: **$cgDirConf/conf.env** - User config

  Default: $cgDirConf=~/.config/libre-bib

  This is optional, but it is useful for defining all of the common
  settings across all of your bib directories. Copy $PWD/conf.env to
  this location and uncomment and change the values.

  If you use the same cgDbName for all the bibs, then you'll want to
  define different table name. Using different DB names is safer for
  keeping the different bibs separate, but more DB setup will be
  needed.

  Typically these vars will be the same across all your bibs:
  cgDbName, cgDbHost, cgDbPassCache, cgDbPassHint, cgDbUser,
  cgUseRemote cgDbHostRemote, cgDbPortRemote, cgSshUser, cgSshKey

+ File: **$PWD/conf.env** - Document config

  This is required, but everything can be commented out. Uncomment the
  ones that are specific to the current bib document.

*** Annotated conf.env

Understanding the variables in the conf.env file will probably give
you the best understanding of how the libre-bib application works.

The conf.env files are the core configuration files for the libre-bib
app.  They are executed in this order, so the last definition wins.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
1. . /opt/libre-bib/etc/conf.env
2. . ~/.config/libre-bib/conf.env   # $cgDirConf Optional
3. . ./conf.env
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

+ Var: **cgDebug=false**

  If "true" then some diagnostic messages will be output.

+ Var: **cgNoExec=false**

  If "true" then things will be checked with non-destructive reads.
  Execution will stopped before anything would be changed.

  Note: this is not the same as the "-n" option. "-n" will show the
  commands that will be executed. cgNoExec forces the command to not
  make any destructive changes. Files might be copied to backup
  locations, but tables and files will not be changed.

+ Var: **cgVerbose=true**

  If "true" the commands being executed will be shown and there
  could be more status output as things are run.

  Note: Currently some errors messages are not output if this is set
  to "false". If you see no output and no changes, the set this to
  "true" and try again.

+ Var: **cgDirBackup="backup"**

  This is the directory name (or path) where backup files are put.
  "~" numbers will be put after duplicate backups. With no "/"
  at the beginning, the name will be relative to $PWD.

+ Var: **cgDirConf="$HOME/.config/libre-bib"**

  Config files that are common for your user can be put here.  If you
  have multiple bib directories, then this will be useful. This should
  be an absolute path.

+ Var: **cgDirEtc="etc"**

  Templates and other doc related files are put here. Initially they
  are copied from /opt/libre-bib/etc/. The files are copied to
  cgDirBackup if a command would change any of the files.

+ Var: **cgDirLibreofficeConf="$HOME/.config/libreoffice/4/user/database/biblio"**

  This is the location of Libreoffice's bibliography DB connection
  information. The path might need to be changed for different
  Libreoffice varsions.

+ Var: **cgDirStatus="status"**

  When a command updates a file, a date-stamped status file is created
  in the cgDirStatus directory. If a dependent file has a newer time
  than it's corresponding status file, then the update command will be
  run.

  Deleting all the files in the cgDirStatus dir will force all of the
  commands to run. That is, they will not check to see if things are
  newer.

+ Var: **cgDirTmp="tmp"**

  Temporary working files are put in this dir.  This is usually
  relative to $PWD.  If set to an absolute location, be sure there is
  space and that it is unique across all users and bib processes that
  could be run. For example, do not define it to "/tmp" because when
  you run "bib clean" that would remove all files and dirs in /tmp !

+ Var: **cgBackupNum=10**

  This variable defined the number of backup files or tables to be
  kept. This can be set to 2 to 100.

+ Var: **cgDbHost="127.0.0.1"**

  Usually this will always be set to the localhost IP. That works
  better than using a name or localhost.

+ Var: **cgDbName="biblio_example"**

  This is the name of the database.

+ Var: **cgDbUser="$USER"**

  This is the name of your DB user. Typically it is the same as your
  login user name, but you can used any name.

+ Var: **cgDbPassHint="b4n"**

  This will be shown when you are prompted for the DB User's password.

+ Var: **cgDbPassCache="$cgDirTmp/.pass.tmp"**

  When you use commands that need to connect to the DB you will be
  prompted for the user's DB password. It will be saved here.  It is
  not encrypted, so don't use the DB User/Pass for sensitive DBs.

+ Var: **cgDbPortLocal="3306"**

  This is the port for the DB, on the system where the DB is running.

+ Var: **cgUseRemote=false**

  If "true" then the remote DB will be accessed over a ssh tunnel.
  See the ssh setup section for the details on setting up the tunnel.

+ Var: **cgDbHostRemote="NAME.example.com"**

  If you are using a DB on another system, then define that system's
  name here.

+ Var: **cgDbPortRemote="3308"**

  This will be the port for the DB tunnel. It can be most any unused
  port number.

+ Var: **cgSshUser="$USER"**

  This is your user name on the remote system.

+ Var: **cgSshKey="$HOME/.ssh/id.KEY-NAME"**

  This is the ssh key name for accessing the remote system. This will
  be used to define the config file for setting up the ssh tunnel.

+ Var: **cgDocFile="example.odt"**

  This it the whole reason for this app and hopefully this shows why
  you went through the work of creating the biblio.txt file.

  This is your Libreoffice document file that contains bibliographic
  references. {REFs}

+ Var: **cgLoFile="biblio.txt"**

  This is the text file you will use for adding and updating
  bibliographic entries. This is much easier to manage and backup than
  using the DB for everything.

  biblio.txt and biblio-note.txt are the files you will be editing the
  most.  biblio.txt is where you will be putting most of the
  bibliographic information about a book, article, web page, video, etc.

  If you have setup a LibraryThing DB (see: https://www.librarything.com/home)
  you can export a tsv file of your LibraryThing DB to librarything.tsv.
  Then you can run "bib update-lo" to update empty "lo" table fields from
  the "lib" DB table. See the "LibraryThing" section for more details.

  The key.txt file just gives some quick tip on the kind of values you
  can put after the Tags. It isn't used anywhere else, so you can
  edit or delete the file.

+ Var: **cgDbLo="lo"**

  This is the name of the primary LibreOffice bibliographic DB table.

+ Var: **cgDbBib="bib"**

  When the lo table is updated this table is created to do some simple
  formatting, so the bibliography will not be cluttered with duplicate
  commas when there are empty values.

+ Var: **cgBackupFile="$cgDirBackup/backup-lo.csv"**

  If you run the backup-lo command this is where the backup will be
  put. If there is already one there, then that will be backed up.

+ Var: **cgUseLib=false**

  Set this to "true" if you will be using a Library Thing export.

+ Var: **cgLibFile="librarything.tsv"**

  This is the name of the tsv (Tab Separated Value) file that was
  exported from Library Thing.

  Using LibraryThing export your DB to librarything.tsv file
  https://www.librarything.com/home

+ Var: **cgDbLib="lib"**

  This is the name of the LibraryThing table that will be created
  from cgLibFile.

** Commands
- Commands are entered after "bib". For example: "bib setup-bib"
- Just type "bib" for a quick list of commands.
- To bring up this manual in your default browser, type: "bib help"
- More than one command can be used. They will be run in
  order. Execution will stop at the first command that
  fails. ("ignored" errors are OK.) For example, you have modified some
  entries in biblio.txt and you have modified your libreoffice
  document with these new references. You could run: "bib import-lo
  update-lo ref-new ref-update"
- If a command doesn't run, it could be the files are up-to-date.  If
  you want to force a command to run, remove the status/ file
  associated with the command, or "touch" one of the dependent files.
  For example: import-lo will only run if the biblio.txt file is newer
  than the last time import-lo was run. To force it to run: "rm
  status/import.lo.date"
*** Cmd: setup-bib
*** Cmd: connect
*** Cmd: check
*** Cmd: edit

This will run: $EDITOR $cgDocFile &

*** Cmd: import-lo
- Import any changes to $cgLoFile (biblio.txt). The lo table will be
  backed-up in the DB.

*** Cmd: export-lo
*** Cmd: backup-lo
*** Cmd: import-lib

Import the librarything.tsv file to the lib table.

*** Cmd: update-lo
*** Cmd: ref-new

New biblio {REF} tags have been added to your odt file. Run this command
to update your odt file with the current biblio entries found in the
lo table. If there are no new entries, the file will be unchanged.

If the file is changed, the original file will be found in the
backup/ dir. So your odt file can be restored if there are problems.

If the lo table has been updated with different values, then run
the bib-update command.

Internal: see /opt/libre-bib/etc/cite-new.xml for the template
that will be used.

This will format the entries with the "Endnote Characters" style, and
insert the non-empty bib-field values.

*** Cmd: ref-update

If the lo table has been updated with different values, then run this
command to update the odt file with the new values. This command will
not modify any new {REF} tags.

The original file will be found in the backup/ dir. So your odt file
can be restored if there are problems. It could be there are no
changes to the file, but this command doesn't check for difference,
it just replaces all of the biblio-entries it finds in the odt file.

Internal: see /opt/libre-bib/etc/cite-update.xml for the template
that will be used.

This will only update non-empty bib-field values. The style won't be
touched.

*** Cmd: save-style
*** Cmd: update-style
*** Cmd: status
*** Cmd: clean
*** Cmd: version
*** Cmd: add, edit
*** Cmd: help
* Appendix
** A. Backups

+ DB Tables: If a table exists and cgBackup is "true", then the table will be
  copied to the table name with a datestamp (_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS)
  appended. For example, bib -> bib_2023-04-02_14-18-37

+ Files: If a file exist and cgBackup is "true", then the file will be
  copied to FILE.bak. If the .bak file exist then a ".~N~" will be
  appended after that (larger Ns are more recent).

+ Backup cleanup: run TBD????, it will prompt to confirm deletes of backup
  tables or files.

+ To restore a table. In mysql, follow this example:

    drop table `bib`;
    RENAME TABLE `bib_2023-04-02_14-18-37` TO bib;
** B. Customizing the defaults

- If you are managing multiple bibliographies, you might have some
  common settings. For example, most of the things related to a remote
  DB will be the same.

- The user config file is the best place for defining the common
  settings: $cgDirConf/conf.env

- If you change the /opt/libre-bib/etc/conf.env file, you will need to
  rebuild some things. Here are the steps:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<pre class="in">
cd /opt/libre-bib/etc
edit conf.env
bash -n conf.env   # syntax check
cd BIB-PROJECT     # any of your bib project dirs
bib rebuild        # update user default file, and conf.php
</pre>
#+END_EXPORT

- Source /opt/libre-bib/etc/conf.env and conf.env in a bash script
  call your own Makefile, other bash scripts, or php scripts to run
  things. Your php scripts could include /opt/libre-bib/etc/conf.php
  to define the ENV vars as globals, or just use $_ENV['cgVarName'].

** C. Emacs Org Mode - Outine

- doc/example/example-outline.org

** D. Full Example
- This assumes you have everything installed and working. This will use
  the example files.

<p>This will have created a join table with Titles are in the "lo" and

#+END_EXPORT

 - Now you can add the Bibliography to the end of your document, and
   setup the styles for the different Type of entries.

** E. Build



** F. Maps

The best source for the maps can be found in bin/util.php.

*** bib to libreoffice names

This has some minor differences when looking at the field in the
Bibliography style section.

*** lo-file to lo-table

This maps the lo text file Tag names to the lo-table field names.

*** lo-table to bib-table

Do some simple formatting of the lo-table values and put them in the
bib-table, so that the Bibliography style is easily setup.

*** lib-table to lo-table

This maps the LibraryThing field names to the Libreoffice Bibliography
field names.
